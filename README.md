# Web3D Introduction - Final Project

## Foreword

You will find here the rules for the project evaluating our Web3D introduction class.
It is split into **steps**. The more you will do, the better the grade. Please however, keep in mind a few things:

- Pay attention to the way you write and structure your code, as I will also be evaluating this.
- I will give you all instructions on what I want to see, but you are free to do what your imagination tells you for what I did not mention (scale, position, rotation...)
- Web3D is also a matter of creativity. Do not hesitate to do more!

And, of course, have fun!

**You can always contact me, after a class or by mail, for any question**

## How to submit

- Send a mail to yohann.degliesposti@gmail.com
- Title: [WEB3D][PROJ] - login
- Send the code as a zip file. You can send me a google drive link if the package is too heavy.

**Be careful**: You will lose points if the project does not compile or if the node_modules are still there.

## Deadline

You have until **Sunday, 10th of December, 2023 - 11:42PM** to submit the project.

## Building and Launching

- The project should be built with vite.js
- All assets should be served under a `/static/` folder, and each should be put in a proper folder (3D models under `models`, textures under `textures`...)

I will do `npm run dev` to launch your project. **Make sure that it works**
